1- I like, He used swtich statement.<br>
2- He did not use proper coding standards (To shortend the code instead writing extra code). <br>
3- He wrote the same code again and again instead of creating a seprate function.<br>
4- He has to use IF-ELSE seprate function so it can be used in an other place like I did JObType Function.<br>
5- He did not use proper laravel convention and wrote more custom code.<br>
6- Did not remove commented code from the function and many comments.<br>
