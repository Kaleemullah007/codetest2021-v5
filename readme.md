1- I like, He used swtich statement.
2- He did not use proper coding standards (To shortend the code instead writing extra code). 
3- He wrote the same code again and again instead of creating a seprate function.
4- He has to use IF-ELSE seprate function so it can be used in an other place like I did JObType Function.
5- He did not use proper laravel convention and wrote more custom code.
6- Did not remove commented code from the function and many comments.
